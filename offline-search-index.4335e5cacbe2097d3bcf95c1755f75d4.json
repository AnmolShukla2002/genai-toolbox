[{"body":"About AlloyDB for PostgreSQL is a fully-managed, PostgreSQL-compatible database for demanding transactional workloads. It provides enterprise-grade performance and availability while maintaining 100% compatibility with open-source PostgreSQL.\nIf you are new to AlloyDB for PostgreSQL, you can create a free trial cluster.\nRequirements IAM Permissions By default, AlloyDB for PostgreSQL source uses the AlloyDB Go Connector to authorize and establish mTLS connections to your AlloyDB instance. The Go connector uses your Application Default Credentials (ADC) to authorize your connection to AlloyDB.\nIn addition to setting the ADC for your server, you need to ensure the IAM identity has been given the following IAM roles (or corresponding permissions):\nroles/alloydb.client roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer Networking AlloyDB supports connecting over both from external networks via the internet (public IP), and internal networks (private IP). For more information on choosing between the two options, see the AlloyDB page Connection overview.\nYou can configure the ipType parameter in your source configuration to public or private to match your cluster’s configuration.
